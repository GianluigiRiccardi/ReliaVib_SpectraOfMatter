# üß† The Sound of MathWorks  
### *ReliaVib Experimental Series ‚Äì Spectra of Matter*  

**Author:** Gianluigi Riccardi  
**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Tool:** MATLAB Mobile  
**Device:** iPhone accelerometer (100 Hz sampling rate)  
**Engraver:** HBC Signograph 25 (nominal frequency ‚âà 60 Hz / 3600 rpm)

## üîπ Project Overview  
*The Sound of MathWorks* is an experimental vibration analysis exploring the intersection between **engineering, physics, and art**.  
Using MATLAB Mobile as a portable acquisition system, the experiment captures the vibration signature produced while engraving the word **‚ÄúMathWorks‚Äù** on a glass plate.  

Each letter generates its own micro-vibrational pattern ‚Äî a mechanical voice shaped by the gesture itself.  
The result is a **real vibration spectrum**: the physical echo of a name that represents engineering and science itself.  

---

## üîπ Setup (critical)
- In **MATLAB Mobile ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Sensors**, set **Motion sensor sample rate = 100 Hz**.  
- Keep the app **in foreground** during acquisition and **disable battery saver** to avoid downsampling.  

---

## üîπ Methodology
1. **Data acquisition**  
   - The smartphone‚Äôs accelerometer measures vibration during engraving.  
   - **Sampling rate: 100 Hz**  |  Duration: 15 s.  
   - Data recorded using `accellog(m)` in MATLAB Mobile.  

2. **Signal processing**  
   - RMS acceleration and FFT derived from raw acceleration data.  
   - Power spectral density computed with `pwelch()`.  
   - Dominant frequencies identified using `findpeaks()`.  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Time-domain and frequency-domain plots generated in MATLAB.  
   - Exported at 300 DPI for publication and analysis.

## üîπ How to Run
1. Open **MATLAB Mobile** on your smartphone.  
2. **Set Motion sensor sample rate to 100 Hz** (Settings ‚Üí Sensors).  
3. Enable the **Accelerometer** sensor.  
4. Run the script from MATLAB Desktop or MATLAB Online.  
5. Hold the phone near the engraver handle and press **ENTER** to start.  
6. Review the plots generated automatically at the end of acquisition.  

*(Tip: the script warns if Fs < 50 Hz.)*

## üîπ Concept
> *Every vibration is a signature ‚Äî  
>  every signal is matter speaking back.*  

This project belongs to the **ReliaVib ‚Äì Spectra of Matter** experimental line, combining predictive-maintenance analytics with human creativity and digital physics.
